MLOPS solution for stock price prediction model 
==============================

## Project overview
This project aims to develop a stock model prediction system that 
leverages Machine Learning (ML) to accurately predict stock prices. 
The core of this project is built on Python and utilizes ML model to 
analyze historical stock data and predict future trends. 
This project is enhanced with a complete MLOps solution for 
development, deployment, and monitoring of the ML models.

## Features 

* Data Processing: Automated scripts to fetch, clean, and prepare historical stock data for training.
* Model Training: Implementation of multiple ML models to evaluate their performance on stock price prediction.
* Model Evaluation: Rigorous testing and validation strategies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the models.
* Model Deployment: Automated deployment of the best-performing model to a production environment.
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment processes.
* Monitoring: Tools to monitor the model's performance in production and trigger retraining if necessary.

## Technology Stack

Python: Primary programming language for model development and scripting.
NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical processing.
